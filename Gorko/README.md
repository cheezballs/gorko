# GORKO Custom Textures
Allows you to change the texture of ship sails and banners to any image accessible by URL.

## Installation
Drop this in your `bepinex/plugins` folder.

## Current Issues
- Banners have mirrored UV data at the mesh level which requires more work. Currently any image used on a banner type will slice the image in half, mirror and tile to fit. 

## Future features
- Option to have ship sails change to your pre-configured URL when you start driving. 
- Improved synchronization when textures change in the vicinity of other players.
- Custom list of short aliases for "favorite" images.
- Display custom ship names.
- More built-in banner types. 
- Optional bonus comfort for pieces with custom images.
